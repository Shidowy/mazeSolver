# Maze Solver


This is a Python project that implements a maze solver using various algorithms, including Dijkstra's, A*, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The maze is generated randomly using Kruskal's algorithm, and users can interact with the application to select algorithms and visualize the solving process.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Randomly generated maze using Kruskal's algorithm.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from four algorithms to solve the maze:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Algorithm
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Visual Interface**: Interactive graphical representation using Pygame.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Select algorithms and reset the maze or path easily.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
